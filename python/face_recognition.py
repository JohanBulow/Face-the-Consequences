# Uses face_recognition lib and cv2 to recognize a face that has been encoded via,
# capture_photo_and_encode.py. Each frame is downscaled to 25%, but video display is 
# at full resolution. Will also only detect faces in every other frame.
# If a face is recognized, a POST will be sent to the raspberry, emulating the attempt
# to be verified. Code is based on an existing example from face_recognition.py, but further
# improved and shaped to fit the project.
